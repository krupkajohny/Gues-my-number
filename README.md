# Gues my number 

This project is a part of an online JS course I have been studying. It is focused mainly on practicing DOM manipulation fundamentals.

How it works:
- js generates a random number (1-20) on the background 
- user can guess the number by typing a number into the input and pressing a check button!
- js compares a guess with a random number
